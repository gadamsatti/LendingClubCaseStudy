## General Information
- Lending Club provides loans to borrowers, but a lot of borrowers default, that is they do not return the borrowed amount along with accumulated interest back to the lenders.
- Such defaults results in the monetary loss for the businesses or lenders.
- Hence, the purpose of this case study is to identify some of the prominent factors which can help understanding borrowers who have higher probability of defaulting.
- In this project, some of the factors have been analyzed and identified from the data and have been reported.

## Conclusions
- Majority of borrowers asked for rounded number that is 5000 , 10,000 as observed from the Distribution graph
- Majority of the people were funded
- In the 129 people whose loan were not approved, majority of the people paid off the loan so it is better to provide them loans and reduce the business loss 
- Majority of the people have took the 36 months tenure period
- Majority of the people have taken loan in the end of the year
- Majority of the people have taken loan in 2011 and after every year, the number of loan borrowers have increased 
- California state has highest number of loan count
- People having 10+ year experience are majority of applicants of the loan 
- Majority of the people who applied for the loan are living on rent or mortgage
- The interest rate in charged off were higher than that of fully paid which may infer that higher interest rate could result in higher charge offs
- The percentage of defaulters are higher in 60 months term with about 25% charge-off whereas it is just 11% for 36 month term. So, there is a possibility that longer term loans are more risky and prone to higher default
- People having less income are more likely to default. 
- Small business are more likely to charge off compared to other purpose as they are the 28% of people who charged off
- By observing the median and 3rd quartile people who have taken higher installment amount are likely to charge off 
- As the grades gets lower, charge off rate increases proportionately
- As the sub-grades gets lower, charge off rate increases proportionately
- Higher the dti,more likely the charge off 
- As number of bankruptcies increases the charge off rate also increases
